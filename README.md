# Presentations/Slides
A repository too keep my presentations in one place. 

### Do you want to use my slides?
Most of them will be in Norwegian, but feel free to use them as you like.
I will be thankfull if you give me a shoutout if you find them usefull. 

### Disclaimer
The content in the presentations are based on _my personal experiences_ with different topics/technology, so you might not always agree with me. Also, I don't update them unless I'm giving the presentation again, so there might be examples that are outdated if the tech has changed.
